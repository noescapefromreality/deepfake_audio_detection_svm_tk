# deepfake_audio_detection_svm_tk
A Python project with GUI (Tkinter) which uses the SVM classifier to perform a binary classification between real and spoof audio files.

The project was heavily inspired by the paper "Deepfake Audio Detection via MFCC Features Using Machine Learning" and uses some code from here for the training process, link: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9996362
